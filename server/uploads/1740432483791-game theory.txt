b) u can pick at max k => so 


this can be done usring 
a1   a2  a3 .... a4
g1 grundy value for a1 
g2 grundy value for a2 
.
.
gn grundy value for an

if g1^g2^..gn cout<<1<<endl;
else cout<<0<<endl;

now what is grundy value ==> mex ( of all equivalent value  )

mex ( a1 ==> all grandy values were we can reach fter performing operation on a1 ))
